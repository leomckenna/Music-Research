**Music Research**

This repository contains all files related to my research on music analysis using both R and Python. The project explores audio features, artist comparisons, and performance trends 
through a combination of data scraping, statistical modeling, and signal processing.

R scripts include statistical tests, plotting, and data wrangling using tidyverse tools.

Python scripts include audio scraping, feature extraction, and machine learning pipelines.

librosa_files/ focuses on time-frequency representations and musical feature extraction using librosa.

csvs/ contains:

Input data: song-level metrics, metadata, Spotify audio features

Output files: processed features, model predictions, summary statistics
